# Arduino Mock

This repository is an extraction of the Arduino mocked code from [arduino-ci](https://github.com/Arduino-CI/arduino_ci). See [CHANGELOG.MD](https://github.com/dcc-lt/arduino_mock/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for list of changes.

It is meant to be used as a replacement for the original Arduino libraries with [PlatformIO]() native environment and the integrated [Unity]() testing framework.
